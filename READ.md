This is the first milestone project I will make for the SDSU software development bootcamp.
I have been tasked with creating a project that should showcase the skills and create a milestone for the skills I have learned in HTML, CSS and JS.
The format of the milestone project will be a game that runs in the browser.
I have chosen to create a Super Mario esque multi room platformer game with 3 levels
GENERAL IDEAS OF WHAT I WANT THE GAME TO BE
I will create a unique character and world for that character to run in
There will be 3 enclosed levels that the player must navigate through using the arrow keys to move and space bar to jump

OUTLINE OF TWO WEEK PLAN TO FINISH THE GAME
**IMPORTANT: MAKE EVERYTHING EXTREMELY SIMPLE AND EASY. I ONLY HAVE TWO WEEKS TO MAKE THIS. MAKE A FUNCTIONABLE WORKING GAME FIRST AND THEN ADD ON THE COOL STUFF WHEN I ALREADY HAVE A WORKING PROJECT. MAKE A BASIC TUTORIAL, BASIC OBSTACLE COURSE, BASIC FIGHT SCENE AND BASIC END SCENE THAT WORK. THEN ADD ANYTHING ELSE THAT I WANT.**
