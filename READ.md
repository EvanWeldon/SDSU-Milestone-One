This is the first milestone project I will make for the SDSU software development bootcamp.

I have been tasked with creating a project that should showcase the skills and create a milestone for the skills I have learned in HTML, CSS and JS.

The format of the milestone project will be a game that runs in the browser.

I have chosen to create a Super Mario esque multi room platformer maze game with 3 levels

GENERAL IDEAS OF WHAT I WANT THE GAME TO BE
I will create a unique character and world for that character to run in
There will be 3 enclosed levels that the player must navigate through using the arrow keys to move and succesfully complete the maze.

 **IMPORTANT: MAKE EVERYTHING EXTREMELY SIMPLE AND EASY. I ONLY HAVE TWO WEEKS TO MAKE THIS. MAKE A FUNCTIONABLE WORKING GAME FIRST AND THEN ADD ON THE COOL STUFF WHEN I ALREADY HAVE A WORKING PROJECT. MAKE A BASIC TUTORIAL, BASIC OBSTACLE COURSE, BASIC FIGHT SCENE AND BASIC END SCENE THAT WORK. THEN ADD ANYTHING ELSE THAT I WANT.**

OUTLINE OF TWO WEEK PLAN TO FINISH THE GAME

- DAY ONE- WEDNESDAY 30th
  - Create the GitHub repo for my game
  - Choose a game assets pack from itch.io
  - Complete the READ.md
 
- BEFORE SATURDAY CLASS-
   - Have a folder for all of my images
       - character model
       - world model for each level
       - Model for doors
       - At least have the first very simple maze level completed
   
- DAY TWO- SATURDAY 3rd
   - Create all of the basic JS code that I will use in my game
       - Be able to move the character with arrow keys and code the collision blocks
       - Enter doors
       - Move throughout the levels
       - Create maze level 2 and 3
        - These will be finished for homework if not completed in class
      
- DAY THREE- MONDAY 5th-
   - Import all of the character and world models
   - Game should be pretty much completely done by this point
 
- DAY FOUR- WEDNESDAY 7th
   - Create an end credits scene congratulating the player for completing all three levels
   - This is the win con and should be activated upon entering door 3.
 
- DAY FIVE- SATURDAY 10th
   - Create a start game button/page
   - Work through any bugs
   - By this time the game should be fully ready to be presented to the class
